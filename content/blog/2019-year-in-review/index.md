description: Looking back on what I have done in 2019.

This is my yearly recap like the year before.
I can say that this year is my favorite year of all time. 
There are a lot of unexpected things that happened this year and I am grateful for it.


### 1. I Started Working Remotely
Working remotely has been one of my biggest goals. I don't really love to work in an office with fixed schedule. I had the opportunity to join a US based company in September and I took it. It has been my greatest decision this year! By working remotely I can do many things outside of work and it is the most amazing thing about remote working. I wrote about it in a seperate [blog post](https://juliancanderson.com/blog/working-remotely).

### 2. I lost 5 kg
I put a goal to lose 1 kg a month and at the end of the year I only manage to lose 5kg in total. I am not disappointed about it, in fact I am happy that I finally lose some weight. I failed for so many years because of my eating habit. This year I lost some weight by doing intermittent fasting, eating salad (I don't really like salad), and carbs diet. I am planning to lose another 7kg and gain some muscle too in 2020. Fingers crossed 🤞🏻.

### 3. I saved up some money
I am not that good with money. Once my income increase I tend to reward myself by buying stuffs or upgrading some of my older stuffs. In the middle of the year I read [I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramith Sethi](https://www.bookdepository.com/I-Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich-Ramit-Sethi/9780340998052?ref=grid-view&qid=1577762136252&sr=1-1) and it changed my life. I managed to save up more money by making a spending plan each month. I also tracked all of my spendings by using [Spendee](http://spendee.com/). Subscribing to their pro version turns out to be a great investment for me. 

### 4. I failed my workout routine
I planned to work out 3 times a week. I managed to do that routine for 6 months and I stopped. The reason why I stopped is because I got busy and working out is not a priority for me and I got stressed out in the middle of the year and it made me lazy and went back to my unhealthy routine. I know that working out is important and somehow I still didn't prioritize it. Being healthy is my top 3 goals next year and I will have to start small to redbuild the habit.

### 5. I rebuilt my website
I have rebuilt my website for a couple times. I had this plan in mind for a really long time but I did not really have the time to do the rebuild. I finally finished my personal website this November and I am happy about the end result. There are still some things to improve and I should find time to do the improvements.

### 6. I rebuilt my wardrobe
I used to love graphic t-shirts and this year I made a decision to ditch all of them. I went for a more minimal clothing like plain t-shirt, plain oxford buttoned down, and plain polo shirt. It feels really good to wear them and it makes me stop spending a lot of money on those expensive piece of clothing. You can get a plain t-shirt for $10 at Uniqlo with a decent quality!

### 7. I launched a newsletter
I am inspired by my good friend [Micah](https://micahcarroll.com/) to launch my own newsletter. My main goal is to develop my writing skills. I am planning to write at least once a week for this newsletter for 2020.

### 8. I stopped podcasting
I built my own podcast earlier this year. I talked to many amazing people on my podcast and I loved it. I stopped because I have some problems at that time and then I lost the momentum of building the podcast. I don't know what will be the future of the podcast, I might continue building it or I might build a new one. Nothing is certain until now 😕.


### 9. I did not read 24 books
I planned to read 2 books per month or 24 books a year for 2019. I was confident that I can achieve this goal easily. But, I failed. The reason why is that I reread most of the books that I have finished in 2019. I can go through the book 2-3 times because I need to digest more from the books. I think it is okay to read less in a year, the thing that matters is that you apply what you have learned from the books.

I think these are all I have in mind for now.
I have been preparing for 2020 since the start of December. I have a lot of things to do and achieve this year.
But the 3 main focus are : <b>financial, health, and mindset</b>.

I hope that you all have a great 2019 and 2020 ahead. If you have any feedback, comments, or things to share feel free to message me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/juliancanderson) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juliancanderson).
